## üìÇ Datasets

The following three datasets can be used to train and evaluate PCB defect detection models:

- **DeepPCB Dataset**  
  - Link (Access Code: TzQ2):  
    ```
    https://pan.quark.cn/s/7ee803e03889
    ```
  - Description: The DeepPCB dataset is a publicly available PCB defect detection dataset containing various defect types (e.g., ‚Äúmissing copper,‚Äù ‚Äúsolder skip,‚Äù etc.). All images have a uniform resolution and complete annotations, making it suitable for small-object defect detection tasks.

- **PCBDefect Dataset**  
  - Link (Access Code: 1BMD):  
    ```
    https://pan.quark.cn/s/367b4007a88a
    ```
  - Description: The PCBDefect Dataset provides both synthetic and real-world PCB defect samples covering a wide range of surface defects and blemishes. It is useful for enriching model generalization during training.

- **PCBSurface Defect Dataset**  
  - Link:  
    ```
    https://robotics.pkusz.edu.cn/resources/dataset/
    ```
  - Description: Released by the Robotics and Intelligent Manufacturing Research Group at Shenzhen University, this dataset contains real PCB surface defect images and corresponding annotation files. It‚Äôs ideal for evaluating detection performance in real-world scenarios.
